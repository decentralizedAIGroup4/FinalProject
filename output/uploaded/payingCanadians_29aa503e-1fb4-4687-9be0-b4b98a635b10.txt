For AIOC, I guess I could pay Canadians to do final assembly of items, then import them into the U.S. as made in canada with domestic and foreign components, but idk .... seems cheaper than paying 3-10x for the same items ... will see how this goes.... the overhead at 3x would be so high that I would basically break even to keep the same price point [https://github.com/skuep/AIOC]
