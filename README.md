##Final Project

To complete this bootcamp you must ideate, document, develop and deploy a project with your group using one or many of the topics covered in this bootcamp.

Pay attention to the workshops during the next week and prototype different ideas and concepts with your group.

When you reach a conclusion with your group about the project you want to build, start by creating a new repository in your GitHub account and start working on a README.md file to document your idea and coordinate the work.
